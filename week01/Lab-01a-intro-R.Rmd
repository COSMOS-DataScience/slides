## Reminder

- Close all apps on your computer.  
- Open slides for this session from the cluster website (https://cosmos-datascience.netlify.app).

# Introductions

---

# First things first:
- Do you have a computer?
- Do you have R on your computer?
- Do you have RStudio on your computer?

---

# A Walkthrough of RStudio
### Why it's a nice environment for R coding


It is an IDE(Integrated Development Environment) which we use to manage and execute R code.

It is open-source and free, and incoperated with other platforms.

### Create a new document in which to do R coding

# R review
## Object assignment operator

```{r}
birth_year <- 2007
```

---

# R review

R is case-sensitive


```{r error=TRUE}

my_age <- 2024 - birth_year

My_age
```

## Variables in R

`character`: takes string values (e.g. a person's name, address)

--

`integer`: integer (single precision)  

--

`double`: floating decimal (double precision) 

--

`numeric`: integer or double  

--

`factor`: categorical variables with different levels(AD, no AD)

--

`logical`: TRUE (1), FALSE (0)  

---
## Variables in R

typeof is the function we use to check the type


```{r}
typeof(1)
typeof(1L)
typeof(as.integer(1))
```

# R review

If something comes in quotes, it is not defined in R. 


```{r}

ages <- c(25, my_age, 32)

names <- c("Menglin", "Mine", "Rafael")

data.frame(age = ages, name = names)
```

# R review
## Functions and Arguments

```{r eval=FALSE}
do(something)
```

`do()` is a function;   
`something` is the argument of the function.

--

```{r eval=FALSE}
do(something, colorful)
```

`do()` is a function;   
`something` is the first argument of the function;   
`colorful` is the second argument of the function.

## Getting Help

In order to get any help we can use `?` followed by function (or object) name. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
?c
```


---

# Some basic data structures
- variables/assignment
- combine/vector
- matrix

```{r eval=FALSE}
temp_variable = 1
temp_vector = c(1, 2, 3)
temp_matrix = matrix(c(1,2,3,4), nrow=2, ncol=2, 
                     byrow=TRUE)
```
