`slice()` and `filter()` 

---

`select` is used to select certain variables in the data frame. 


.left-panel[
```{r}
select(alzheimer_data, 
       height, weight) %>%
  head()
```
]

--

.right-panel[

```{r}
alzheimer_data %>% 
  select(height, weight) %>%
  head()
```

]

---

`select` can also be used to drop certain variables if used with a negative sign.

```{r}
select(alzheimer_data, -id, -educ) %>%
  head()
```

---

## Selection helpers

`starts_with()`  
`ends_with()`  
`contains()`  

---

```{r}
select(alzheimer_data, starts_with("lp")) %>%
  head()
```

---

```{r}
select(alzheimer_data, contains("arhip")) %>%
  head()
```

`slice()` and `filter()` 

---

.pull-left[
`slice()` subsetting rows based on a row number.

The data below include first six rows from third to seventh. Including third and seventh.

```{r}
slice(alzheimer_data, 3:5) %>%
  head()
```


]

--

.pull-right[

`filter()` subsetting rows based on a condition.

The data below includes rows when the age is 90.

```{r}
filter(alzheimer_data, age == 80) %>%
  head()
```

How many participants are in diagnosis group 1 and age 80?

```{r}
alzheimer_data %>% 
  filter(age == 80 & diagnosis==1) %>%
  head()
```


---


```{r}
alzheimer_data %>% 
  filter(age == 80 & diagnosis==1) %>% 
  nrow()
```

Here is when piping helps. We can pipe into other functions such as `nrow()`


---

Q. How many patients are in in diagnosis group 1 and are female?


```{r}
alzheimer_data %>% 
  filter(diagnosis ==1 & female == 1) %>% 
  nrow()
```

---

We have done all sorts of selections, slicing, filtering on `alzheimer` but it has not changed at all. Why do you think so?

```{r}
glimpse(arthritis)
```

---

Moving forward we are only going to use, `age`, `female` `diagnosis`, `educ`, `height` and `weight`. Let's clean our data accordingly and move on with the smaller `alzheimer` data that we need.

---

```{r}
alzheimer_data %>% 
  select(age, female, 
         diagnosis, educ, height,
         weight)
```

---

```{r}
alzheimer_data <- 
  alzheimer_data %>% 
  select(age, female, 
         diagnosis, educ, height,
         weight)
```


---

```{r}
glimpse(alzheimer_data)
```

`mutate()` adds new variables and preserves existing ones

```{r}
alzheimer_data <-
  alzheimer_data %>% 
  mutate(weight_kg = 0.453592*weight)

colnames(alzheimer_data)
```


---

We can use `mutate()` to change the data type of a variable by creating a new variable that has the desired data type.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to use `mutate()` to change the data type of a variable using a conditional statement:

```{r}
alzheimer_data %>%
  mutate(gender = case_when(female == 1 ~ "female",
                         female == 0 ~ "male")) %>%
  head()
```

---

The function group_by() from dplyr groups the rows by the unique values in the column specified to it. Note that there is no perceptible change to the dataset after running group_by(), until another dplyr verb such as mutate(), summarise(), or arrange() is applied on the “grouped” data frame.

```{r}
alzheimer_data %>%
  head()
```

---

Once we group the data, we won't see much difference other than `Groups:   age_gp [2]` statement, everything else will be similar. 

```{r}
alzheimer_data %>% 
  group_by(diagnosis) %>%
  head()
```


---

```{r}
alzheimer_data %>% 
  group_by(diagnosis)  %>% 
  summarize(mean(age, na.rm = TRUE))
```

---

We can also calculate other descriptives as well as number of observations for each group.

```{r}
alzheimer_data %>% 
  group_by(diagnosis)  %>% 
  summarize(mean_age=mean(age, na.rm = TRUE),
            median_age=median(age, na.rm = TRUE),
            n_diag = n())

```
